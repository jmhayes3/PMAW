def get_metric_timeseries(asset_slugs, asset_metric, start=None, end=None, interval='1d'):
    """Retrieve historical timeseries data for an asset.

    Parameters
    ----------
        asset_slugs: str, list
            Single asset slug string or list of asset slugs (i.e. bitcoin).
        asset_metric: str
            Single metric string to filter timeseries data.
            Available metrics include:

                - blk.cnt
                    The sum count of blocks created each day.
                - txn.fee.avg
                    The USD value of the mean fee per transaction.
                - txn.cnt
                    The sum count of transactions that interval. Transactions represent a bundle of intended
                    actions to alter the ledger initiated by a user (human or machine). Transactions are counted
                    whether they execute or not and whether they result in the transfer of native units.
                - txn.tsfr.val.adj
                    The sum USD value of all native units transferred removing noise and certain artifacts.
                - sply.circ
                    The circulating supply acknowledges that tokens may be held by projects/foundations which have
                    no intent to sell down their positions, but which have not locked up supply in a formal contract.
                    Thus, circulating supply does not include known project treasury holdings (which can be
                    significant). Note that an investor must carefully consider both liquid and circulating supplies
                    when evaluating an asset, and the two can vary significantly. A risk of depending entirely on
                    circulating supply is that the number can change dramatically based on discretionary sales from
                    project treasuries.
                - mcap.circ
                    The circulating marketcap is the price of the asset multiplied by the circulating supply. If
                    no price is found for an asset because no trades occurred, the last price of the last trade is
                    used. After 30 days with no trades, a marketcap of 0 is reported until trading resumes.
                - reddit.subscribers
                    The number of subscribers on the asset's primary subreddit
                - iss.rate
                    The percentage of new native units (continuous) issued over that interval, extrapolated to one year
                    (i.e., multiplied by 365), and divided by the current supply at the end of that interval.
                    Also referred to as the annual inflation rate.
                - mcap.realized
                    The sum USD value based on the USD closing price on the day that a native unit last moved
                    (i.e., last transacted) for all native units.
                - bitwise.volume
                    It is well known that many exchanges conduct wash trading practices in order to inflate
                    trading volume. They are incentivized to report inflated volumes in order to attract traders.
                    "Bitwise Volume" refers to the total volume over 10 exchanges identified by Bitwise to be free
                    of wash trading activities. They tend to be regulated exchanges. However, that does not necessarily
                    mean that the volume reported by other exchanges is 100% wash trades. As such, the Bitwise Volume
                    underestimates the total volume.
                - txn.tsfr.val.avg
                    The sum USD value of native units transferred divided by the count of transfers
                    (i.e., the mean "size" in USD of a transfer).
                - act.addr.cnt
                    The sum count of unique addresses that were active in the network (either as a recipient or
                    originator of a ledger change) that interval. All parties in a ledger change action
                    (recipients and originators) are counted. Individual addresses are not double-counted.
                - fees.ntv
                    The sum of all fees paid to miners in native units. Fees do not include new issuance.
                - exch.flow.in.usd.incl
                    The sum USD value sent to exchanges that interval, including exchange to exchange activity.

                - exch.flow.in.ntv.incl

                    The sum USD value withdrawn from exchanges that interval, excluding exchange to exchange activity.'
                - txn.vol
                    The sum USD value of all native units transferred (i.e., the aggregate size in USD
                    of all transfers).
                - fees
                    The sum USD value of all fees paid to miners that interval. Fees do not include new issuance.
                - exch.flow.out.ntv.incl

                    exchange activity.

                    The sum USD value of all native units held in hot or cold exchange wallets.
                - diff.avg
                    The mean difficulty of finding a hash that meets the protocol-designated requirement
                    (i.e., the difficulty of finding a new block) that interval. The requirement is unique to each
                    applicable cryptocurrency protocol.
                - daily.shp
                    The Sharpe ratio (performance of the asset compared to a "risk-free" asset) over a window of time).
                - txn.tsfr.cnt
                    The sum count of transfers that interval. Transfers represent movements of native units from one
                    ledger entity to another distinct ledger entity. Only transfers that are the result of a
                    transaction and that have a positive (non-zero) value are counted.

                - nvt.adj
                    The ratio of the network value (or market capitalization, current supply) divided by the adjusted
                    transfer value. Also referred to as NVT.
                - exch.flow.out.ntv

                    represented as the US dollar amount earned if all native units were sold at the closing price
                    on the same day.
                - bitwise.price
                    Volume weighted average price over Bitwise 10 exchanges.
                - new.iss.ntv
                    The sum of new native units issued that interval. Only those native units that are issued by a
                    protocol-mandated continuous emission schedule are included (i.e., units manually released from
                    escrow or otherwise disbursed are not included).
                - blk.size.bytes.avg

                - price
                    Volume weighted average price computed using Messari Methodology
                - real.vol
                    It is well known that many exchanges conduct wash trading practices in order to inflate
                    trading volume. They are incentivized to report inflated volumes in order to attract traders.
                    "Real Volume" refers to the total volume on the exchanges that we believe with high level of
                    confidence are free of wash trading activities. However, that does not necessarily mean that the
                    volume reported by other exchanges is 100% wash trades. As such, the Messari "Real Volume" applies
                    a penalty to these exchanges to discount the volume believed to come from wash trading activity.

        start: str
            Starting date string for timeseries data. A default start date will
            provided if not specified.
        end: str
            Ending date string for timeseries data. A default end date will
            provided if not specified.
        interval: str
            Interval of timeseries data. Default value is set to 1d.

            For any given interval, at most 2016 points will be returned. For example, with interval=5m,
            the maximum range of the request is 2016 * 5 minutes = 7 days. With interval=1h, the
            maximum range is 2016 * 1 hour = 84 days. Exceeding the maximum range will result in
            an error, which can be solved by reducing the date range specified in the request.

            Anything under 1 day requires an enterprise subscription. Please email enterprise@messari.io
            for information.

            Interval options include:
                - 1m
                - 5m
                - 15m

        to_dataframe: bool
            Return data as DataFrame or JSON. Default is set to DataFrame.

    Returns
